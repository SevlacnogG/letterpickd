# Letterpickd

Tired of scrolling through your movies lists for 2 hours, looking for what to watch?
Can't help yourself but let your pizza get cold before you actually find an interesting movie?
Then **Letterpickd** is the solution!

A simple software that takes parameters and returns a random movie from a Letterboxd list.

## Current version:

Right now, **it's only possible to get a random movie from any user's watchlist**.
Dropdown menus for genre and decade are available, but don't work yet because I need to
adjust some aspects of how it gets the total number of movies, movies per page and pages.

## Future implementations:

- Decade and genre searches;
- Exceptions for 404 and other issues; 
- Multiple decade and genre combinations;
- Displaying poster, description and details such as duration, cast and studio
to the result's textbox;
- Enhanced GUI;
- Web application.

## Installation:

1. Download the .zip or clone the repository, which can be done through:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/letterpickd.git

2. Remember to install requirements!
